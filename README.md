# Capstone Project: Predicting Mental Health Trends in Canada

## Overview
This project aims to analyze how economic, social, and environmental factors influence mental health trends across different provinces in Canada. By leveraging machine learning models, we predict perceived mental health levels over time, helping identify key predictors that impact mental well-being.

## Objectives
Use publicly available health data for predictive modeling.

Develop a forecasting model for mental health trends.

Create a Power BI dashboard to visualize insights.

Compare predicted vs. actual outcomes to improve accuracy.
## Data Sources
The datasets used in this project are sourced from:

Statistics Canada (Mental health perception data)

Bank of Canada (Inflation rates)

Google Trends (Search trends on mental health topics)

Weather Canada (Climate and seasonal patterns)

Other Economic Indicators (Unemployment rates, financial stress levels)
## Methodology
1.Data Collection & Preprocessing:

  Extracted and cleaned datasets from various sources.

  Handled missing values and standardized formats.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

  Analyzed trends in mental health perceptions.

  Identified correlations with economic, social, and environmental factors.

3.Predictive Modeling:

Regression Models:

  Multivariate Linear Regression

  Time Series Regression (ARIMAX, SARIMAX)

  Random Forest Regression, XGBoost

Classification Models (if categorical prediction needed):

  Logistic Regression

  Random Forest Classifier

  Gradient Boosting Classifier

4.Model Validation & Refinement:

  Compared actual vs. predicted results.

  Fine-tuned models to improve accuracy.

## Power BI Dashboard
Presents real-time predictions and trends.

Visualizes how economic and environmental factors impact mental health.

Enables interactive exploration of data insights.
## Challenges Faced
Limited availability of real-time health datasets.

Inconsistent update frequency of certain economic indicators.

Integrating multiple data sources for a comprehensive model.
## Next Steps
Finalizing unemployment dataset collection.

Running feature selection to optimize model performance.

Refining predictions using more advanced models.

Deploying the final model and dashboard
